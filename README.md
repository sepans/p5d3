# Using d3.js utilities for data visualization in p5.js
<!--*by [Sepand Ansari](http://sepans.com/)-->


A series of examples for using d3.js utility functions minimally in p5.js without inter-mingling their different paradigms.

## Who is this tutorial for?
This tutorial doesn't intend to encourage using d3.js along with p5.js. These two libraries use different paradigms and ways of rendering and mixing them without 
care will create cryptic and non-perfomative code. 

Moreover d3.js is fast and very flexible and powerful and covers almost every data visualization 
use case, so there is no need to complement it with p5.js library. But the power of d3.js comes at a price: It requires somehow advanced familiarity 
with Javascript techniques (like method chaining and functional programing) and [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) to completely understand how it works.

On the other hand p5.js (the new implementation of Processing framework in Javascript) is designed to be simple especiallly for non-proficient Javascript coders 
Thus using d3.js utility functions makes it possible to create non-trivial data visualizations with ease. 
This is also very helpful to get familiar with the world of d3 and be able to switch to d3.js for data visualizations.
